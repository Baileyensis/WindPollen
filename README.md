# WindPollen

I'm trying to figure out how to model pollen dispersed on the wind. I am most interested in cherry pollen, but gymnosperm and other angiosperm pollen were also counted and are included in the data set.

Data set includes:
60 observations from Orchard CSO (12 are NAs) x 4 pollen types = 240 (48 NAs)
71 observations from Orchard HBA (1 is NA) x 4 pollen types = 284 (4 NAs)

I have included ALL of the data without dropping levels, etc, so that you can see eveything that is there.

This data set does not (yet?) include pollen counts from ~288 other observations. These were never counted due to time constraints. Theoretically, I COULD count them and add them to the data set to get more power.

I'm trying to figure out whether I can glean anything meaningful from the data that I currently have.
