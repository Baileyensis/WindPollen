# WindPollen

I'm trying to figure out how to model pollen dispersed on the wind. I am most interested in cherry pollen, but gymnosperm and other angiosperm pollen were also counted and are included in the data set.

Data set includes:
60 observations from Orchard CSO (12 are NAs) x 3 pollen types = 180 (36 NAs)
71 observations from Orchard HBA (1 is NA) x 3 pollen types = 213 (3 NAs)

I have included ALL of the data without dropping levels, etc, so that you can see eveything that is there.
