# WindPollen

I'm trying to figure out how to model pollen dispersed on the wind. 

My data:
	'data.frame':	393 obs. of  10 variables:
 	$ Orchard          : Factor w/ 2 levels "CSO","HBA": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 	$ Location         : Factor w/ 2 levels "CANOPY","ROW": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 	$ Row              : Factor w/ 9 levels "1A","1B","1C",..: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 ...
 	$ Direction        : Factor w/ 2 levels "N","S": 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 ...
 	$ Interval         : Factor w/ 2 levels "AM","PM": 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 ...
 	$ Interval.Duration: int  15 15 15 15 15 15 9 15 9 15 ...
 	$ PollenType       : Factor w/ 3 levels "Cherry","Other angiosperm",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 	$ Count            : int  0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 2 1 ...
 	$ TotalPollen      : int  13 21 12 54 29 27 7 21 15 4 ...
 	$ num              : int  2 4 6 8 10 12 13 14 15 16 ...
 
I collected pollen at two farms (Orchards) during the day and at night (Interval) for 9 or 15 hours (Interval.Duration), respectively. Pollen was collected from points arranged in a 3 x 3 grid (Rows A-B, Columns 1-3). The collection traps faced either North or South (Direction), and were positioned either close to the tree or in the middle of the row (Location). I identified pollen as either Cherry, Other angiosperm, or Gymnosperm (PollenType) and counted the number of pollen grains from each sample (Count).

Data set includes:
60 observations from Orchard CSO (12 are NAs) x 3 pollen types = 180 (36 NAs)
71 observations from Orchard HBA (1 is NA) x 3 pollen types = 213 (3 NAs)

I have fit my data to three model functions in R: glm(), glm.nb() [MASS package], and gam() [mgcv package]. I have used rootograms [countreg package] to assess the fit of my three count regression models. To model the spatial data collection points, I added an mrf smooth function to the Row parameter in the gams. 

I am most familiar with generalized linear models, so gams are new to me, as is the addition of the mrf smooth, but I think, based on what I know of these tools, that they are appropriate to asses my data.

That said, I really am at a loss as to how to choose which model is the best.
